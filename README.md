# stock_analysis

## Project Overview
  ### Why
    Steve was kind enough to give some work to a struggling data analyst.  This first contract I hope satisfies, and encourages more work from Steve in the future.
    
  ### What
     A basic analysis of stocks that Steves parents are very fond of would like to invest in.  The expected out put is to show that some stocks are not very good and others are probably best to put money towards.
     
     A secondary goal was presented by Steve after the first iteration of the report was turned over with the request to speed it up a bit.
     
  ### How
     Rather than make a sheet with formulas that do a bunch of stuff, we will be using VBA to automate alot of lookups and iterate through the whole lot of data to get to the conclusion we need to present.
     
     To hit the secondary goal we refactored our code to be a bit more inline with the expectation that parsing through the code less would lead to significant reduction of overhead.
     
     
## Results
  What we have found in our results is that
